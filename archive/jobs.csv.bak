Operating at the forefront of aerospace and space, cybersecurity and digital identity, we’re driven by a mission to build a future we can all trust.

In Singapore, Thales has been a trusted partner since 1973, originally focused on aerospace activities in the Asia-Pacific region. With 2,000 employees across three local sites, we deliver cutting-edge solutions across aerospace (including air traffic management), defence and security, and digital identity and cybersecurity sectors. Together, we’re shaping the future by enabling customers to make pivotal decisions that safeguard communities and power progress.

As an intern at AIR Lab, you will support the development of advanced ATM capabilities—such as data processing, system modelling, user interfaces for controllers, or machine-learning modules for sustainable flight operations. You will work in a collaborative, multidisciplinary environment, gaining exposure to aviation R&D, real-world integration challenges, and the conceptualization of future air-traffic infrastructure.  
You are eager to dive deep into technical challenges, identify solutions, and effectively communicate your findings, helping the team learn and grow. You are enthusiastic about exploring new technologies and finding innovative ways to apply your knowledge.

* Develop code, scripts or models (e.g., for simulation, data-ingestion, analytics, UI behaviour) under guidance.
* Assist with data collection, cleaning and analysis (e.g., flight-trajectory, radar, ADS-B data sets).
* Test and validate prototypes or simulations: document findings, issues and improvement suggestions.
* Present results to the team and propose next-step contributions.

What You’ll Gain  

* Hands-on exposure to Air Traffic Management R&D and sustainable aviation systems.
* Experience working within a joint innovation lab backed by CAAS & Thales, with access to real aviation-industry challenges.
* Mentorship from industry and research engineers; opportunities to contribute to live proofs-of-concept.
* Strengthened professional portfolio in software/systems/AI in aviation context.
* Potential for further opportunities within AIR Lab or in the Thales Group.

**Education**  

* Currently enrolled in or recently graduated from a Diploma, Bachelor’s or Master’s programme in Computer Science, Software/Systems Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Data Science/Analytics, Human-Computer Interaction or related fields.

Desirable Skills  

* Good programming experience (e.g., Python, Java, C++), or experience with ML/AI frameworks (depending on the role).
* Solid analytical skills, able to handle data sets, simulation environments or system-level thinking.
* Interest in aviation, air traffic management, sustainable operation or emerging architectures is a plus.
* Good communication skills; ability to work in a multidisciplinary team.
* Self-starter attitude, willingness to learn and adapt in a fast-moving R&D environment.
* Eligibility to intern in Singapore (work permit, etc) as required.

At Thales, we’re committed to fostering a workplace where respect, trust, collaboration, and passion drive everything we do.
